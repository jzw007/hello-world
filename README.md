# hello-world
I am getting back into computers in general. I would rather make a living using my brain a pose to using my body. 

I am farly rusty on my software development skills and programing.  But I refuse to keep doing a job that suck the life out of me working me into the ground with no back up plan. Look forward to learnign and growing and bettering myself.
